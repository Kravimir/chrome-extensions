Google Chrome (Chromium) Extensions I've written.

You can download the extensions from [the Microsoft Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/search?developer=David%20%22Kravimir%22%20S).

You can also enable "developer mode" in "chrome://extensions" and install them as (unpacked) directories.

I've submitted them to Opera as well, but they have not been reviewed there yet.

Since Google imposes a one-time sign-up fee, I'm not submitting them to the Chrome Store until someone makes a donation and requests I do so.
